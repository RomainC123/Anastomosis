      "The role of fecal diversion using a loop ileostomy in patients undergoing rectal resection and anastomosis is controversial. There has been conflicting evidence on the perceived benefit vs. the morbidity of a defunctioning stoma. This is a review of the relevant surgical literature evaluating the risks, benefits, and costs of constructing a diverting ileostomy in current colorectal surgical practice.\n",
      "Retrospective and prospective articles spanning the past 50 years were reviewed to identify the definition of an anastomotic leak, evaluate risk factors for AL, and assess methods of evaluation of the anastomosis. We then pooled the evidence for and against fecal diversion, the incidence and consequences of stomal complications, and the evidence comparing loop ileostomy vs. loop colostomy as the optimal method of fecal diversion.\n",
      "Evidence shows that despite the fact that fecal diversion does not decrease postoperative mortality, it does significantly decrease the risk of anastomotic leak and the need for urgent reoperation when a leak does occur. Diverting stomas are a low-risk surgical procedure from a technical standpoint but carry substantial postoperative morbidity that can greatly hamper patients’ quality of life and recovery. High-risk patients such as those with low colorectal anastomoses, colo-anal anastomoses, technically difficult resections, malnutrition, and male patients seem to reap the greatest benefit from fecal diversion.\n",
      "Fecal diversion is recommended as a selective tool to protect or ameliorate an anastomotic leak after a colorectal anastomosis. It is most beneficial when used selectively in high-risk patients with low pelvic anastomoses that are at an increased risk for AL. New tools are needed to identify patients at high risk for anastomotic failure after anterior resection.\n",
      "Some of the most prevalent trends in colorectal surgery over the past 20 years have been the move toward more minimally invasive operations and a growing emphasis on sphincter preservation. Higher rates of sphincter-sparing procedures and the avoidance of a permanent stoma have resulted in an increase in the use of very low pelvic anastomoses in contemporary colorectal surgery. These very low anastomoses are mostly employed in patients undergoing low anterior resection for rectal cancer but also in patients with benign conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulitis.\n",
      "The most feared and devastating complication of a pelvic anastomosis is an anastomotic leak. Leaks can lead to fatal abdominal sepsis and often lead to the loss of the pelvic anastomoses and to a permanent ostomy. Even in cases where the anastomosis is salvaged, the inflammatory effects of the leak usually result in poor functional outcomes and incompliance of the neorectum. Proximal diversion of the GI tract to protect high-risk pelvic anastomoses has been advocated in traditional colorectal surgical practices. This dogma has been challenged in recent years with many authors questioning the need and perceived benefits of diversion for all patients with a low pelvic anastomosis. This is a review of the contemporary surgical literature aimed at evaluating the risks, benefits, and costs of diverting ileostomy in current colorectal surgical practice.\n",
      "The incidence of anastomotic leak after colorectal surgery varies widely, ranging from as low as 1 % to as high as 25 % in some studies. There has been little consensus about the definition and diagnostic criteria for AL. Bruce et al. performed a systematic review of 49 studies and found as many as 29 different definitions for AL. To combat this issue, the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer recently published a universal definition and clinical grading system. Their consensus was that AL is defined as “a defect of the intestinal wall at the anastomotic site leading to a communication between intra- and extraluminal compartments.” The authors did notice that despite the variability of earlier definitions, they all based AL on clinical symptoms that were subsequently confirmed with endoscopy, radiology, or reoperation.\n",
      "The incidence of AL after anterior resection is estimated at ~11 % but can rise as high as 50 % when asymptomatic radiographic leaks are included. The risk of an anastomotic leak is actually better appreciated by focusing on patient and technical factors that predict anastomotic leak. The literature has suggested that patients who are male, have malnutrition, recent perioperative weight loss, significant cardiovascular disease, are on perioperative steroids, have a history of concurrent alcohol abuse, require perioperative blood transfusions, are advanced in age, are obese, and those with a prior history of pelvic radiation, are all at high risk for an anastomotic leak. A large retrospective analysis was done by Kang et al. of undergoing elective anterior resection for rectal cancer from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Multivariate analysis showed malnutrition as the strongest risk factor of AL  = 2.81) followed by fluid and electrolyte disorders, male sex, and presence of diverting stoma. With regards to preoperative radiation, the evidence for it as a risk factor for AL remains controversial. A retrospective analysis of 825 patients showed by multivariate analysis that neoadjuvant radiation therapy was a risk factor for AL. Conversely, a retrospective analysis of 1862 patients by Nisar et al. over a 30-year period showed no significant effect of neoadjuvant radiation on AL. This was confirmed in a multicenter RCT of 1350 patients with rectal cancer that received neoadjuvant radiation vs. initial surgery. The rate of AL at 1 month postoperative was found to be similar between the two arms.\n",
      "On the other hand, the strong link between low tumors and low pelvic colorectal anastomoses and the higher leakage rates has been well established by Bertelenet al. They showed that in 163 patients that exhibited AL after rectal resection, tumors below 10 cm from the anal verge had an increasing risk of AL with closer distance to the anal verge. Rullier also showed that in 272 consecutive patients who underwent resection, a low anastomosis at 5 cm from anal verge had six times higher risk of AL after multivariate analysis.\n",
      "To minimize the risks of postoperative anastomotic complications, surgeons have employed various intraoperative techniques to assess anastomosis integrity. These include basic mechanic patency tests, endoscopic visualization techniques, and more recently, microperfusion assessment technology.\n",
      "Basic mechanical patency tests include air and fluid leak tests including traditional air leak testing, saline leak, and methylene blue leak tests. These tests are limited by the fact that there is no direct visualization of the lumen. Thus, the anastomosis is assessed by occluding the proximal lumen and then filling the intraluminal cavity with air or fluid and assessing for leakage. A systematic review of two randomized controlled trials by Beard et al. and Ivanov et al. enrolled a total of 203 patients. The study assigned patients to intraoperative air leak testing vs. no testing in control group. The study found three patients in the test group requiring reoperation for a postoperative AL and one patient dying after reoperation. Conversely, the control group had a total of five reoperations for AL with a total of two mortalities. The risk of a clinical leak in the tested group was 5.8 % compared to 16 % in the control group.\n",
      "Testing the anastomosis using intraoperative endoscopy on the other hand gives the surgeon direct visual intraluminal assessment and, if needed, the chance for therapeutic intervention. A systematic review of five nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated endoscopic testing enrolled a total of 950 patients and 509 patients in the tested group. The incidence of AL was 7.7 % in the positive test group, 7.3 % in the negative test group, and 5.9 % in the control group. There was no significant difference in the postoperative AL rate in the test and control groups. It should be noted that the AL rate in the positive test group might be falsely lowered by the intraoperative interventions taken after the discovery of a positive test.\n",
      "Microperfusion techniques for evaluating a colorectal anastomosis have been gaining popularity recently. The technology allows the analysis of blood flow and tissue perfusion so the surgeon can assess areas of ischemia and thus change the initial site of the anastomosis or reconstruct as necessary. Parmeggiani et al. performed a RCT using intraoperative colonoscopy with narrow band imaging of mucosal perfusion of a total of 47 patients. Seven patients in the test arm had colonoscopic abnormalities that needed intervention vs. one patient in the control group that required revision of their anastomosis. Kudszus et al. used laser fluorescence angiography and indocyanine green to retrospectively evaluate the perfusion of colorectal anastomoses. A large cohort of 402 patients was identified with 201 in the test arm and 201 in the historic control arm. They found that 28/201 in the test group had resection margins revised and subsequently only 7/201 had a clinical leak vs. 15/201 in the control group that leaked and required reoperation. Furthermore, in the test group, 5/201 had a clinical impression of ischemia that was disproved by fluorescence angiography and were not revised, none of these five cases leaked.\n",
      "Intraoperative colorectal anastomotic testing continues to evolve with the advancement of surgical technology. While mechanical and endoscopic testing seem to have some moderate benefits in decreasing AL, there is growing evidence that microperfusion techniques and autofluorescent dyes may hold the most impact in the future of reducing anastomotic complications. Large RCTs of microperfusion techniques are still pending and will be needed to validate this exciting new technology for routine clinical surgical practice.\n",
      "Anastomotic leak increases postoperative mortality after colorectal surgery due to pelvic sepsis and peritonitis with published rates up to 22 %. Furthermore, in a large cohort of 403 patients undergoing anterior resection between 1971 and 1991, Bell et al. showed that after adjusting for lymph node metastasis and resection margins, multivariate analysis identified a significant association between AL and local cancer recurrence 3.8; P < 0.05). More recently, in 2010, Katoh et al. showed that among stage 2 rectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection, AL was the strongest prognostic factor affecting 5-year disease-free survival. Moreover, the study revealed that the reduction in the 5-year disease-free survival seen in node-negative AL patients was comparable to that of patients with node-positive disease. Finally, a meta-analysis of all studies of AL in rectal cancer from 1965 till 2009 was conducted and included 21 eligible studies. The authors noted that AL had a negative impact on local recurrence and long-term survival, but not on distant recurrence.\n",
      "These findings have led to the traditional surgical doctrine advocating fecal diversion to potentially ameliorate the devastating effects of an anastomotic dehiscence.\n",
      "Loop ileostomy or colostomy is the traditional technique to prevent anastomotic leak by proximal fecal diversion. Defunctioning stomas continue to be widely used by the surgical community at large. There still exists considerable controversy regarding whether fecal diversion does actually reduce the risk of an anastomotic leak. There actually seems to be better evidence suggesting that the presence of a defunctioning stoma will lessen the magnitude of sepsis and morbidity that occurs if a leak does indeed develop.\n",
      "Among studies that selectively used a defunctioning stoma, Gastinger et al. performed a retrospective multicenter study of a total of 2729 patients where 881 received a stoma and 1848 did not. They found no difference in overall AL rates between the two groups but did find a significantly lower surgical intervention rate in those patients who had a protective stoma. Karanjia et al. performed a retrospective single-center study that evaluated 219 patients with 157 receiving a stoma. They found similar leak rates for patients who were diverted vs. those that were not. However, they did find a higher number of major clinical leaks in the no stoma group and saw an 8 % rate of fecal peritonitis in that group compared to a 0.8 % rate in the diverted group. Similarly, a retrospective single-center analysis of 249 patients by Leester et al. and 272 patients by Rullier et al. showed that a diverting stoma did not prevent AL and recommended against its routine use. Both studies, however, did advocate its use for high-risk anastomosis due to its ameliorating effect on the morbidity of AL should it occur.\n",
      "Studies that reject the use of stomas include a retrospective multicenter study by Fielding et al. who evaluated 2057 patients and found a higher leak rate with the stoma group. They suggested that surgeons with low individual AL rates do not need to resort to diversion. Enker et al. performed a retrospective single-center study of 681 patients and showed no reduction of rate of AL with stoma in patients undergoing a low or ultra low anterior resection. These findings were reflected by a large multicenter retrospective Swedish study by Matthiessen et al. who randomly sampled 432 out of 6833 patients for diversion but found no significant difference in AL rate. A retrospective, single-center comparative study by Dehni et al. showed a similar clinical leak rate of 6 % with defunctioning stoma vs. 17 % without after examining 258 consecutive cases.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are also studies that recommend routine use of defunctioning stomas. A retrospective, single-center study by Poon et al. evaluated 148 patients and found a 3.3 % rate of AL with stoma vs. 12.6 % without a stoma. A large retrospective, multicenter trial involving 75 German centers of 482 patients that showed a protective effect of diverting stomas against clinical AL. In a large retrospective, multicenter Dutch TME trial of 924 patients the presence of a pelvic drain and the presence of a defunctioning stoma decreased AL rates. Finally, in a retrospective, multicenter analysis of 621 patients by Kessler et al., an AL was observed in only 8.7 % of the diverted patients as compared with 15.4 % if a protective stoma was not placed.\n",
      "Most recently, in 2013, Nurkin et al. conducted a retrospective review of 211 hospitals and a total of 1791 patients that underwent low anterior resection. One thousand two hundred sixty-six patients underwent a low pelvic anastomosis with 606 receiving a diverting stoma and 660 receiving no stoma. They found no differences in wound complications, sepsis, or incidence of septic shock between the two groups. However, patients in the stoma group were more likely to develop postoperative acute kidney injury. n 525 patients who had a colo-anal anastomosis without a stoma, there was a significant risk of sepsis, septic shock, and reoperation. Multivariate analysis also showed that patients who had a colo-anal anastomosis without a stoma were at a considerable risk for serious postoperative morbidity.\n",
      "The literature on the true effects of diversion or defunctioning stomas remains difficult to reconcile. Nonrandomized trials are hampered by the fact that there exists a strong general patient selection bias in these studies favoring surgery without a stoma. This bias is inherent since these studies hinge on the surgeon’s discretion at selectively creating a stoma or diverting those anastomoses in which complications are anticipated.\n",
      "Graffner et al. randomized 50 patients into two groups: 25 received a defunctioning stoma and 25 received no stoma. Three clinically relevant AL were seen in the no stoma group vs. only one AL in the stoma group. The overall leakage rate was 8 %. Pakkastie et al. evaluated 134 patients and showed a clinical leakage rate of 16 % in the stoma group, whereas 32 % of patients without a defunctioning stoma developed clinically evident leakage. Although all patients with a leak in the no stoma group had to be reoperated, only one reoperation was necessary in the patients with a defunctioning colostomy.\n",
      "A large recent RCT on the role of diverting stoma was performed by Matthiessen et al. Two hundred thirty-four patients were randomized into two arms: stoma vs. no stoma. An anastomotic leak developed in 10.3 % of patients with a stoma and in 28 % of undiverted patients. This difference was statistically significant. As expected, the number of reoperations was significantly higher in the group of patients without a stoma. The largest RCT was done by Chude et al. and included 256 patients with 120 randomized to no diversion and 136 randomized to diverting ileostomy. The stoma group was found to be superior with 3 clinical leaks vs. 12 in the no diversion group. Furthermore, the stoma group required no return to the operating room compared to two patients in the no diversion group who required reoperation.\n",
      "Huser et all performed a systematic review of all retrospective studies comparing the role of diverting ileostomy. This included studies that selectively used stomas, routinely used stomas and those that rejected using stomas. No clear consensus from these studies could be reached due to the aforementioned selection bias that meant most “high-risk” patients were included in the diversion group. However, it should be noted that despite the strong selection bias favoring the no stoma group, patients who received a diverting ileostomy fared no worse.\n",
      "Huser also performed a meta-analysis of randomized prospective studies on diverting ileostomy, which revealed a significantly lower risk of anastomotic leak and lower risk of reoperation in the stoma group. However, the mortality between the two groups was found to be comparable. These results were validated by a more recent Cochrane meta-analysis of more RCTs by Montedori et all of a total of six RCTs that comprised 332 patients in the stoma group vs. 316 in the no diversion group. The pooled analysis showed that the use of a defunctioning stoma resulted in less anastomotic leakage 0.33; 95 % confidence interval  = 0.21–0.53) and less urgent reoperation with no significant difference in mortality.\n",
      "Despite the potential benefits of fecal diversion for many patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the construction of an abdominal stoma while common remains fraught with many complications and should not be considered trivial. The stoma is usually constructed as the last step of a complex operation and even though it might not be as technically challenging, meticulous surgical technique should be adhered to as a means to minimize complications. Complications after stomas range from minor, requiring only local care, to the devastating, requiring reoperation and prolonged inpatient care.\n",
      "It has been estimated that 40–50 % of abdominal stomas that are deemed temporary are never reversed signifying that the decision to create a stoma is no trivial one and can have a significant effect on patients’ livelihood. Studies have shown a wide range of reported stomal complication rates, ranging from 10 to 60 %. This is likely due to the fact that stomal complications remain poorly defined by the surgical community. Interestingly, the most commonly sited complaint of stoma patients is peristomal skin irritation, which is a complication that is not always recognized by the treating surgeon. Furthermore, in most surgical practices, this is a complaint that is seen and managed by wound ostomy nurses and may not always be reported to the treating surgeon, thus the widely fluctuating stomal complication rates.\n",
      "The risk factors for stomal complications can be divided into patient-centered, procedure-centered, and disease-centered factors. Patient factors include age, gender, BMI, nutritional status, american society of anesthesiologists physical status classification system, and steroid use. Nastro et al. showed a complication rate of 56 % in a large recent series. Rheumatoid arthritis, immobility, high ASA, and surgery for cancer were all found to be independent risk factors. Smoking, diabetes, and malignancy had the highest risk for postoperative stomal complications. With regards to procedure-centered factors, Cottam et al. also prospectively studied 3970 cases in 93 hospitals and found that short stomas with a height less than 1 cm was associated with higher rate of early complications. Procedures performed on an emergent basis were also at higher risk for complications. It is alarming to note that despite the many advances in surgical and postoperative care, the rates of stomal complications remain high. This fact puts more emphasis toward weighing the potential benefits vs. risks of a diverting stoma and the optimization of patient factors preoperatively.\n",
      "A poorly located stoma can be a major source of morbidity and frustration to patients, with most of these issues discovered after patients are discharged home. There has been ample evidence that an improperly located stoma will lead to elements of psychological distress, poor body image, hamper postoperative recovery, and even lead to postoperative depression in some severe cases. This is in an addition to the sizable economic burden that a malfunctioning stoma imposes due to leakage and the requirement of more stomal supplies.\n",
      "Stomal site marking by a wound ostomy nurse should be advocated in all elective cases and even in urgent ones if possible. This not only improves site selection but also introduces the patient and their family to stoma education and resources early on thus empowering postoperative independence. As a general principle, a proper site is one that is away from bony prominences and proposed incisions. A flat area of healthy skin at least 2-in. wide in diameter is ideal, this usually corresponds to an area two thirds of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine toward the umbilicus. The stoma is then brought through the rectus abdominis muscle in a muscle splitting technique. To anticipate potential positional problems, it is recommended to examine patients while they are standing, sitting, and supine as changes in position will elucidate problematic areas of skin creasing and excessive pads of fat. In obese patients, it is recommended that stomas are placed higher than the usual location in areas of the abdominal wall that have thinner subcutaneous fat and thus allowing better visualization and access.\n",
      "These are probably the most commonly encountered yet most underreported complications of stoma use with reported incidences between 18 to 55 %. Skin complications range from mild irritation to large areas of ulceration and infection. This is most optimally prevented by proper stoma placement and construction. Patients with difficulty covering stomas are the highest risk for skin complications. This is particularly true for obese patients who have issues with properly fitting stoma appliances around body folds. The absence of care by wound ostomy nurses has actually been identified as the greatest risk factor for developing these peristomal skin issues. Patients should be assessed for their proficiency at stoma care and appliance placement and removal to minimize mechanical causes of skin damage. Furthermore, although proper fit is crucial in the initial setting, patients need to be constantly refitted postoperatively as stomal swelling decreases and this should be continued for the lifetime of the stoma as the patient’s abdominal wall changes.\n",
      "A notorious complication of stomas and a recurring cause of hospital readmissions are dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities from excessive stoma output. The reported incidence ranges from 1 to 16 %. It is not uncommon to have volumes up to 2 L/day as postoperative bowel edema impairs fluid absorption across mucosal membranes. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypocalcaemia are all common findings and dehydration leading to acute renal injury is surprisingly common. Patients are at highest risk around the fourth to eighth day postoperatively which means that most of them have already been discharged home by the time these issues arise. Patients should be educated to monitor their ostomy output closely and should adjust their PO fluid intake accordingly once output exceeds 1 L/day. Patients are taught that frequent emptying of stoma bags, leakage, nausea, dizziness, malaise, or fatigue are all signs of excessive fluid loss. Patients should avoid hypotonic fluids that cause hyponatremia and use balanced glucose-electrolyte balanced solutions for fluid replacement. Additional pharmacologic treatments such as loperamide and diphenoxylate are used in intractable cases and after concurrent infectious diarrhea have been ruled out.\n",
      "Parastomal hernia is a feared and troublesome long-term complication with its incidence increasing with increasing time from the index operation and reaching 15 to 40 % of all cases. Literature has confirmed that stoma location and type do not increase the risk of parastomal hernia. Risk factors for parastomal hernias mirror known risk factors for other types of abdominal hernias. Nastro et al. showed that the presence of diabetes, poor respiratory status, cancer surgery, and end colostomy as significant risk factors for developing parastomal hernia. Options for correcting parastomal hernias include local repair, relocation, and repair with mesh. Due to the poor results with the first two options, there has been increased recent enthusiasm toward the use of prophylactic mesh, especially with the recent advent of biologic mesh that can be used in contaminated fields. Serra-Aracil et al. conducted a trial of prophylactic biologic mesh vs. a control group with no mesh and saw a significant 25 % reduction in the rate of parastomal hernia between the two groups.\n",
      "Stoma creation has an impact on everyday life with common physical, social, and mental impairments. Robertson et al. showed that stoma patients primarily face skin irritation, smell, leakage, and social stigma ; all issues that are not always brought to the attention of the surgeon. It has been shown that having a stoma negatively affects quality of life and that positive adjustment is related to its acceptance. Having educational programs with dedicated wound ostomy nurse teams have been advocated to increase the quality of life of stoma patients. A systematic review by Danielsen et al. showed that having a dedicated stoma education program and team significantly increased patients’ quality of life, proficiency in management of stoma, reduced length of stay, reduced hospital costs, and increased psychosocial adjustment.\n",
      "Despite the argument for fecal diversion to protect a colorectal anastomosis, the optimal method of doing so is still unclear. Four randomized controlled trials compared loop ileostomy and loop colostomy head to head, with two favoring loop ileostomy and two favoring loop colostomy. Both types of stomas carry a high complication rate and considerable morbidity. A Cochrane review of five randomized trials included a total of 334 patients with 168 patients receiving a loop ileostomy and 166 patients receiving a loop colostomy. Stomal prolapse was seen to be significantly less with loop ileostomy but with concurrent statistical heterogeneity. However, no other clinical factors including mortality, wound infection, parastomal hernia, reoperation, anastomotic leak, incisional hernia, and bowel obstruction were found to be significantly different between ileostomy and colostomy.\n",
      "Thus, current evidence dictates that loop ileostomy is the procedure of choice for fecal diversion due to probable lower risk of stomal prolapse and equivalent clinical outcomes otherwise. Large-scale randomized clinical trials are still needed, however, to validate these results.\n",
      "Fecal diversion via a loop ileostomy or colostomy remains a popular surgical intervention to protect a high-risk colorectal anastomosis. Evidence shows that despite the fact that fecal diversion does not decrease postoperative mortality, it does significantly decrease the risk of anastomotic leak and the need for urgent reoperation when a leak does occur. Diverting stomas are a low-risk surgical procedure from a technical standpoint but carry significant postoperative morbidity that can greatly hamper patients’ quality of life and recovery. The decision for fecal diversion should be a joint one between the patient and surgeon, where comprehensive informed consent of the perceived benefits and concurrent morbidity and complications is essential. Surgeons should strongly consider diversion in patients with low colorectal anastomoses, colo-anal anastomoses, technically difficult resections, malnutrition, and male patients. Loop ileostomy is the fecal diversion procedure of choice due to a significantly lower risk of prolapse and equivalent outcomes with colostomy otherwise.\n"
