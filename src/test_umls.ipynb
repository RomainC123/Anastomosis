      "Colorectal anastomotic leakage is a serious complication leading to major postoperative morbidity and mortality. In the present study  we investigated the early detection of anastomotic leakage before its clinical presentation. Fifty six patients with rectal cancer were included prospectively in this study. All patients underwent elective low anterior resection. Peritoneal samples were collected from the abdominal drains at the first  third  and fifth days postoperatively for bacteriological study and cytokines measurement. Patients were divided into two groups  those without symptomatic or clinical evidence of anastomotic leakage and those with clinical evidence of AL. Study variables included hospital stay  wound infection  operative time  blood loss  height of anastomosis  intraperitoneal cytokines  and microbiological study of peritoneal fluid. Clinically evident AL occurred in eight patients and diagnosed postoperatively on median day 6. Intraperitoneal bacterial colonization and cytokine levels were significantly higher in patients with clinical evidence of AL. Wound infection was significantly higher in anastomotic leakage group. The hospital stay for the patients with anastomotic leakage was significantly longer than those without AL. A significant difference among two groups was observed regarding operative time  blood loss  blood transfusion  and height of the anastomosis. The peritoneal cytokines levels and intraperitoneal bacterial colonization might be an additional diagnostic tool that can support the decision making of surgeons for early detection of anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery. Anastomotic leakage after large bowel resections remains one of the most serious and important complications  despite recent advances in colorectal surgery. Recently  with an increasing number of sphincter preserving procedures  there are more patients at risk for possible leakage. The leakage rate varies from 0.5  to 30 . 5 Clinical anastomotic leakage is associate\n"
