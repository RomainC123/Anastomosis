The role of [31mfecal diversion[0m using a [31mloop ileostomy[0m in [31mpatients[0m undergoing [31mrectal resection[0m and [31manastomosis[0m is controversial. There has been conflicting [31mevidence[0m on the [31mperceived[0m [31mbenefit[0m vs. the [31mmorbidity[0m of a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m. This is a [31mreview[0m of the [31mrelevant[0m [31msurgical literature[0m [31mevaluating[0m the [31mrisks[0m, [31mbenefits[0m, and [31mcosts[0m of constructing a diverting [31mileostomy[0m in current [31mcolorectal surgical practice[0m.
[31mRetrospective[0m and [31mprospective articles[0m spanning the past 50¬†[31myears[0m were [31mreviewed[0m to identify the [31mdefinition[0m of an [31manastomotic leak[0m, [31mevaluate[0m [31mrisk factors[0m for [31mAL[0m, and [31massess[0m [31mmethods[0m of [31mevaluation[0m of the [31manastomosis[0m. We then [31mpooled[0m the [31mevidence[0m for and against [31mfecal diversion[0m, the [31mincidence[0m and [31mconsequences[0m of [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplications[0m, and the [31mevidence[0m comparing [31mloop ileostomy[0m vs. [31mloop colostomy[0m as the [31moptimal[0m [31mmethod[0m of [31mfecal diversion[0m.
[31mEvidence[0m shows that despite the fact that [31mfecal diversion[0m does not [31mdecrease[0m [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmortality[0m, it does significantly [31mdecrease[0m the [31mrisk[0m of [31manastomotic leak[0m and the need for urgent [31mreoperation[0m when a [31mleak[0m does occur. Diverting [31mstomas[0m are a [31mlow-risk[0m [31msurgical procedure[0m from a [31mtechnical standpoint[0m but carry substantial [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmorbidity[0m that can greatly hamper [31mpatients[0m‚Äô [31mquality of life[0m and [31mrecovery[0m. [31mHigh-risk[0m [31mpatients[0m such as those with [31mlow[0m [31mcolorectal anastomoses[0m, [31mcolo-anal anastomoses[0m, technically difficult [31mresections[0m, [31mmalnutrition[0m, and [31mmale[0m [31mpatients[0m seem to reap the greatest [31mbenefit[0m from [31mfecal diversion[0m.
[31mFecal diversion[0m is recommended as a selective tool to [31mprotect[0m or [31mameliorate[0m an [31manastomotic leak[0m after a [31mcolorectal anastomosis[0m. It is most beneficial when used selectively in [31mhigh-risk[0m [31mpatients[0m with [31mlow pelvic anastomoses[0m that are at an [31mincreased[0m [31mrisk[0m for [31mAL[0m. New tools are needed to identify [31mpatients[0m at [31mhigh risk[0m for [31manastomotic failure[0m after [31manterior resection[0m.
Some of the most prevalent [31mtrends[0m in [31mcolorectal surgery[0m over the past 20¬†[31myears[0m have been the move toward more [31mminimally invasive operations[0m and a growing emphasis on [31msphincter preservation[0m. Higher [31mrates[0m of [31msphincter-sparing procedures[0m and the [31mavoidance[0m of a [31mpermanent stoma[0m have resulted in an [31mincrease[0m in the use of [31mvery low pelvic anastomoses[0m in [31mcontemporary[0m [31mcolorectal surgery[0m. These very [31mlow[0m [31manastomoses[0m are mostly employed in [31mpatients[0m undergoing low [31manterior resection[0m for [31mrectal cancer[0m but also in [31mpatients[0m with [31mbenign conditions[0m such as [31minflammatory bowel disease[0m and [31mdiverticulitis[0m.
The most [31mfeared[0m and [31mdevastating[0m [31mcomplication[0m of a [31mpelvic anastomosis[0m is an [31manastomotic leak[0m. [31mLeaks[0m can lead to [31mfatal[0m [31mabdominal sepsis[0m and often lead to the [31mloss[0m of the [31mpelvic anastomoses[0m and to a [31mpermanent ostomy[0m. Even in [31mcases[0m where the [31manastomosis[0m is [31msalvaged[0m, the [31minflammatory effects[0m of the [31mleak[0m usually result in [31mpoor functional outcomes[0m and [31mincompliance[0m of the [31mneorectum[0m. [31mProximal diversion[0m of the [31mGI tract[0m to protect [31mhigh-risk pelvic anastomoses[0m has been advocated in traditional [31mcolorectal surgical practices[0m. This dogma has been challenged in recent [31myears[0m with many [31mauthors[0m [31mquestioning[0m the need and [31mperceived[0m [31mbenefits[0m of [31mdiversion[0m for all [31mpatients[0m with a [31mlow pelvic anastomosis[0m. This is a [31mreview[0m of the [31mcontemporary[0m [31msurgical literature[0m aimed at [31mevaluating[0m the [31mrisks[0m, [31mbenefits[0m, and [31mcosts[0m of diverting [31mileostomy[0m in current [31mcolorectal surgical practice[0m.
The [31mincidence[0m of [31manastomotic leak[0m after [31mcolorectal surgery[0m varies widely, ranging from [34mas low as 1[0m¬†% to [34mas high as 25[0m¬†% in some [31mstudies[0m. There has been little [31mconsensus[0m about the [31mdefinition[0m and [31mdiagnostic criteria[0m for [31mAL[0m. [33mBruce et al.[0m performed a [31msystematic review[0m of [34m49[0m [31mstudies[0m and found [34mas many as 29[0m different [31mdefinitions[0m for [31mAL[0m. To combat this [31missue[0m, the [31mInternational Study Group[0m of [31mRectal Cancer[0m recently published a universal [31mdefinition[0m and [31mclinical grading system[0m. Their [31mconsensus[0m was that [31mAL[0m is defined as ‚Äúa [31mdefect[0m of the [31mintestinal wall[0m at the [31manastomotic site[0m leading to a [31mcommunication[0m between [31mintra-[0m and [31mextraluminal compartments[0m.‚Äù The [31mauthors[0m did notice that despite the [31mvariability[0m of earlier [31mdefinitions[0m, they all based [31mAL[0m on [31mclinical symptoms[0m that were subsequently [31mconfirmed with[0m [31mendoscopy[0m, [31mradiology[0m, or [31mreoperation[0m.
The [31mincidence[0m of [31mAL[0m after [31manterior resection[0m is [31mestimated[0m at ~11¬†% but can rise [34mas high as 50[0m¬†% when [31masymptomatic[0m [31mradiographic[0m [31mleaks[0m are included. The [31mrisk[0m of an [31manastomotic leak[0m is actually better appreciated by focusing on [31mpatient[0m and [31mtechnical factors[0m that predict [31manastomotic leak[0m. The [31mliterature[0m has suggested that [31mpatients[0m who are [31mmale[0m, have [31mmalnutrition[0m, recent [31mperioperative[0m [31mweight loss[0m, significant [31mcardiovascular disease[0m, are on [31mperioperative[0m [31msteroids[0m, have a [31mhistory[0m of [31mconcurrent[0m [31malcohol abuse[0m, require [31mperioperative[0m [31mblood transfusions[0m, are advanced in [31mage[0m, are [31mobese[0m, and those with a prior [31mhistory[0m of [31mpelvic radiation[0m, are all at [31mhigh risk[0m for an [31manastomotic leak[0m. A large [31mretrospective analysis[0m was done by [33mKang et al[0m. of undergoing [31melective anterior resection[0m for [31mrectal cancer[0m from the [31mNationwide[0m [31mInpatient[0m [31mSample[0m. [31mMultivariate analysis[0m showed [31mmalnutrition[0m as the strongest [31mrisk factor[0m of [31mAL[0m ‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.81) followed by [31mfluid[0m and [31melectrolyte disorders[0m, [31mmale sex[0m, and [31mpresence[0m of diverting [31mstoma[0m. With regards to [31mpreoperative[0m [31mradiation[0m, the [31mevidence[0m for it as a [31mrisk factor[0m for [31mAL[0m remains controversial. A [31mretrospective analysis[0m of [34m825[0m [31mpatients[0m showed by [31mmultivariate analysis[0m that [31mneoadjuvant radiation therapy[0m was a [31mrisk factor[0m for [31mAL[0m. Conversely, a [31mretrospective analysis[0m of [35m1862[0m [31mpatients[0m by [36mNisar et al.[0m over a [35m30-year[0m [31mperiod[0m showed no significant effect of [31mneoadjuvant radiation[0m on [31mAL[0m. This was confirmed in a [31mmulticenter RCT[0m of [34m1350[0m [31mpatients[0m with [31mrectal cancer[0m that received [31mneoadjuvant radiation[0m vs. [31minitial[0m [31msurgery[0m. The [31mrate[0m of [31mAL[0m at 1¬†[31mmonth[0m [31mpostoperative[0m was found to be similar between the [34mtwo[0m [31marms[0m.
On the other hand, the strong link between [31mlow tumors[0m and [31mlow pelvic colorectal anastomoses[0m and the higher [31mleakage[0m [31mrates[0m has been well established by [31mBertelenet[0m al. They showed that in [34m163[0m [31mpatients[0m that exhibited [31mAL[0m after [31mrectal resection[0m, [31mtumors[0m below [37m10¬†cm[0m from the [31manal verge[0m had an [31mincreasing[0m [31mrisk[0m of [31mAL[0m with closer [31mdistance[0m to the [31manal verge[0m. [33mRullier[0m also showed that in [34m272[0m [31mconsecutive[0m [31mpatients[0m who underwent [31mresection[0m, a [31mlow anastomosis[0m at [34m5[0m¬†cm from [31manal verge[0m had [34msix[0m times [31mhigher[0m [31mrisk[0m of [31mAL[0m after [31mmultivariate analysis[0m.
To minimize the [31mrisks[0m of [31mpostoperative[0m [31manastomotic complications[0m, [31msurgeons[0m have employed various [31mintraoperative techniques[0m to [31massess[0m [31manastomosis[0m [31mintegrity[0m. These include basic [31mmechanic patency tests[0m, [31mendoscopic visualization techniques[0m, and more recently, [31mmicroperfusion[0m [31massessment[0m [31mtechnology[0m.
Basic [31mmechanical patency tests[0m include [31mair[0m and [31mfluid leak tests[0m including [31mtraditional[0m [31mair leak testing[0m, [31msaline leak[0m, and [31mmethylene blue leak tests[0m. These [31mtests[0m are limited by the fact that there is no direct [31mvisualization[0m of the [31mlumen[0m. Thus, the [31manastomosis[0m is [31massessed[0m by [31moccluding[0m the [31mproximal[0m [31mlumen[0m and then [31mfilling[0m the [31mintraluminal cavity[0m with [31mair[0m or [31mfluid[0m and [31massessing[0m for [31mleakage[0m. A [31msystematic review[0m of [34mtwo[0m [31mrandomized controlled trials[0m by [31mBeard[0m et al. and [33mIvanov et al.[0m enrolled a total of [34m203[0m [31mpatients[0m. The [31mstudy[0m assigned [31mpatients[0m to [31mintraoperative[0m [31mair leak testing[0m vs. [31mno testing[0m in [31mcontrol group[0m. The [31mstudy[0m found [34mthree[0m [31mpatients[0m in the [31mtest group[0m requiring [31mreoperation[0m for a [31mpostoperative[0m [31mAL[0m and [34mone[0m [31mpatient dying[0m after [31mreoperation[0m. Conversely, the [31mcontrol group[0m had a total of [34mfive[0m [31mreoperations[0m for [31mAL[0m with a total of [34mtwo[0m [31mmortalities[0m. The [31mrisk[0m of a [31mclinical leak[0m in the [31mtested group[0m was [34m5.8[0m¬†% [31mcompared[0m to [32m16¬†%[0m in the [31mcontrol group[0m.
[31mTesting[0m the [31manastomosis[0m using [31mintraoperative endoscopy[0m on the other hand gives the [31msurgeon[0m direct [31mvisual[0m [31mintraluminal[0m [31massessment[0m and, if needed, the [31mchance[0m for [31mtherapeutic intervention[0m. A [31msystematic review[0m of [34mfive[0m [31mnonrandomized controlled trials[0m that evaluated [31mendoscopic testing[0m enrolled a total of [34m950[0m [31mpatients[0m and [34m509[0m [31mpatients[0m in the [31mtested group[0m. The [31mincidence[0m of [31mAL[0m was [32m7.7¬†%[0m in the [31mpositive test group[0m, [32m7.3¬†%[0m in the [31mnegative test group[0m, and [32m5.9¬†%[0m in the [31mcontrol group[0m. There was no significant difference in the [31mpostoperative[0m [31mAL[0m rate in the [31mtest[0m and [31mcontrol groups[0m. It should be noted that the [31mAL[0m [31mrate[0m in the [31mpositive test group[0m might be falsely [31mlowered[0m by the [31mintraoperative[0m [31minterventions[0m taken after the [31mdiscovery[0m of a [31mpositive test[0m.
[31mMicroperfusion techniques[0m for [31mevaluating[0m a [31mcolorectal anastomosis[0m have been gaining popularity recently. The [31mtechnology[0m allows the [31manalysis[0m of [31mblood flow[0m and [31mtissue perfusion[0m so the [31msurgeon[0m can assess areas of [31mischemia[0m and thus change the initial [31msite[0m of the [31manastomosis[0m or reconstruct as necessary. Parmeggiani[0m et al. performed a [31mRCT[0m using [31mintraoperative colonoscopy[0m with [31mnarrow band imaging[0m of [31mmucosal perfusion[0m of a total of [34m47[0m [31mpatients[0m. [34mSeven[0m [31mpatients[0m in the [31mtest arm[0m had [31mcolonoscopic abnormalities[0m that needed [31mintervention[0m vs. one [31mpatient[0m in the [31mcontrol group[0m that required [31mrevision[0m of their [31manastomosis[0m. [31mKudszus[0m et al. used [31mlaser fluorescence angiography[0m and [31mindocyanine green[0m to [31mretrospectively evaluate[0m the [31mperfusion[0m of [31mcolorectal anastomoses[0m. A large [31mcohort[0m of [34m402[0m [31mpatients[0m was [31midentified[0m with [34m201[0m in the [31mtest arm[0m and [34m201[0m in the [31mhistoric control arm[0m. They found that [34m28/201[0m in the [31mtest group[0m had [31mresection margins[0m [31mrevised[0m and subsequently [34monly 7/201[0m had a [31mclinical leak[0m vs. [30m15/201[0m in the [31mcontrol group[0m that [31mleaked[0m and required [31mreoperation[0m. Furthermore, in the [31mtest group[0m, [34m5/201[0m had a [31mclinical impression[0m of [31mischemia[0m that was disproved by [31mfluorescence angiography[0m and were not revised, none of these [34mfive[0m [31mcases[0m [31mleaked[0m.
[31mIntraoperative[0m [31mcolorectal anastomotic testing[0m continues to evolve with the [31madvancement[0m of [31msurgical technology[0m. While [31mmechanical[0m and [31mendoscopic testing[0m seem to have some [31mmoderate[0m [31mbenefits[0m in [31mdecreasing[0m [31mAL[0m, there is growing [31mevidence[0m that [31mmicroperfusion techniques[0m and [31mautofluorescent dyes[0m may hold the most [31mimpact[0m in the future of [31mreducing[0m [31manastomotic complications[0m. Large [31mRCTs[0m of [31mmicroperfusion techniques[0m are still pending and will be needed to validate this exciting new [31mtechnology[0m for [31mroutine[0m [31mclinical[0m [31msurgical practice[0m.
[31mAnastomotic leak[0m [31mincreases[0m [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmortality[0m after [31mcolorectal surgery[0m due to [31mpelvic sepsis[0m and [31mperitonitis[0m with [31mpublished rates[0m up to [32m22¬†%[0m. Furthermore, in a large [31mcohort[0m of [34m403[0m [31mpatients[0m undergoing [31manterior resection[0m [35mbetween 1971 and 1991[0m, [31mBell[0m et al. showed that after adjusting for [31mlymph node metastasis[0m and [31mresection margins[0m, [31mmultivariate analysis[0m [31midentified[0m a significant [31massociation[0m between [31mAL[0m and [31mlocal cancer[0m [31mrecurrence[0m [34m3.8[0m; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ[34m0.05[0m). More recently, in [35m2010[0m, Katoh et al. showed that among [31mstage 2 rectal cancer[0m [31mpatients[0m who underwent [31mcurative resection[0m, [31mAL[0m was the strongest [31mprognostic factor[0m [31maffecting[0m [35m5-year[0m [31mdisease-free survival[0m. Moreover, the [31mstudy[0m revealed that the [31mreduction[0m in the [35m5-year[0m [31mdisease-free survival[0m seen in [31mnode-negative[0m [31mAL[0m [31mpatients[0m was comparable to that of [31mpatients[0m with [31mnode-positive disease[0m. Finally, a [31mmeta-analysis[0m of all [31mstudies[0m of [31mAL[0m in [31mrectal cancer[0m from [35m1965[0m till [35m2009[0m was conducted and included [34m21[0m eligible [31mstudies[0m. The [31mauthors[0m noted that [31mAL[0m had a [31mnegative[0m [31mimpact[0m on [31mlocal recurrence[0m and [31mlong-term[0m [31msurvival[0m, but not on [31mdistant recurrence[0m.
These [31mfindings[0m have led to the [31mtraditional[0m [31msurgical doctrine[0m advocating [31mfecal diversion[0m to potentially [31mameliorate[0m the [31mdevastating[0m [31meffects of[0m an [31manastomotic dehiscence[0m.
Loop ileostomy or [31mcolostomy[0m is the [31mtraditional[0m [31mtechnique[0m to [31mprevent[0m [31manastomotic leak[0m by [31mproximal[0m fecal diversion. [31mDefunctioning stomas[0m continue to be widely used by the [31msurgical community[0m at large. There still exists considerable controversy regarding whether [31mfecal diversion[0m does actually [31mreduce[0m the [31mrisk[0m of an [31manastomotic leak[0m. There actually seems to be better [31mevidence[0m suggesting that the [31mpresence[0m of a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m will lessen the [31mmagnitude[0m of [31msepsis[0m and [31mmorbidity[0m that occurs if a [31mleak[0m does indeed develop.
Among [31mstudies[0m that selectively used a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m, [31mGastinger[0m et al. performed a [31mretrospective[0m [31mmulticenter study[0m of a total of [34m2729[0m [31mpatients[0m where [34m881[0m received a [31mstoma[0m and [35m1848[0m did not. They found [31mno difference[0m in overall [31mAL[0m [31mrates[0m between the [34mtwo[0m [31mgroups[0m but did find a significantly lower [31msurgical intervention[0m rate in those [31mpatients[0m who had a [31mprotective stoma[0m. Karanjia et al. performed a [31mretrospective[0m [31msingle-center study[0m that [31mevaluated[0m [34m219[0m [31mpatients[0m with [34m157[0m receiving a [31mstoma[0m. They found similar [31mleak rates[0m for [31mpatients[0m who were diverted vs. those that were not. However, they did find a higher number of major [31mclinical leaks[0m in the no [31mstoma group[0m and saw an [32m8¬†%[0m [31mrate[0m of [31mfecal peritonitis[0m in that [31mgroup[0m [31mcompared[0m to a [34m0.8[0m¬†% [31mrate[0m in the [31mdiverted group[0m. Similarly, a [31mretrospective single-center analysis[0m of [34m249[0m [31mpatients[0m by [31mLeester[0m et al. and [34m272[0m [31mpatients[0m by [33mRullier[0m et al. showed that a diverting [31mstoma[0m did not prevent [31mAL[0m and recommended against its [31mroutine[0m use. Both [31mstudies[0m, however, did advocate its use for [31mhigh-risk anastomosis[0m due to its [31mameliorating effect[0m on the [31mmorbidity[0m of [31mAL[0m should it occur.
Studies that reject the use of [31mstomas[0m include a [31mretrospective[0m [31mmulticenter study[0m by [36mFielding et al.[0m who [31mevaluated[0m [35m2057[0m [31mpatients[0m and found a higher [31mleak rate[0m with the [31mstoma group[0m. They suggested that [31msurgeons[0m with low [31mindividual[0m [31mAL[0m [31mrates[0m do not need to [31mresort[0m to [31mdiversion[0m. [31mEnker[0m et al. performed a [31mretrospective[0m [31msingle-center study[0m of [34m681[0m [31mpatients[0m and showed no [31mreduction[0m of [31mrate[0m of [31mAL[0m with [31mstoma[0m in [31mpatients[0m undergoing a [31mlow[0m or [31multra low anterior[0m [31mresection[0m. These [31mfindings[0m were reflected by a large [31mmulticenter retrospective[0m Swedish[0m [31mstudy[0m by [33mMatthiessen et al.[0m who randomly sampled [34m432[0m out of [34m6833[0m [31mpatients[0m for [31mdiversion[0m but found [31mno significant[0m difference in [31mAL[0m [31mrate[0m. A [31mretrospective[0m, [31msingle-center comparative study[0m by [31mDehni[0m et al. showed a similar [31mclinical leak rate[0m of [32m6¬†%[0m with [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m vs. [34m17[0m¬†% without after examining [34m258[0m [31mconsecutive[0m [31mcases[0m.
On the other hand, there are also [31mstudies[0m that recommend [31mroutine[0m use of [31mdefunctioning stomas[0m. A [31mretrospective[0m, [31msingle-center study[0m by [36mPoon et al.[0m [31mevaluated[0m [34m148[0m [31mpatients[0m and found a [34m3.3[0m¬†% [31mrate[0m of [31mAL[0m with [31mstoma[0m vs. [34m12.6[0m¬†% without a [31mstoma[0m. A large [31mretrospective[0m, [31mmulticenter trial[0m involving [34m75[0m [31mGerman centers[0m of [34m482[0m [31mpatients[0m that showed a [31mprotective effect[0m of diverting [31mstomas[0m against [31mclinical[0m [31mAL[0m. In a large [31mretrospective[0m, [31mmulticenter Dutch TME[0m [31mtrial[0m of [34m924[0m [31mpatients[0m the [31mpresence[0m of a [31mpelvic drain[0m and the [31mpresence[0m of a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m [31mdecreased[0m [31mAL[0m [31mrates[0m. Finally, in a [31mretrospective[0m, [31mmulticenter analysis[0m of [34m621[0m [31mpatients[0m by [33mKessler et al.[0m, an [31mAL[0m was observed in [32monly 8.7¬†%[0m of the diverted [31mpatients[0m as compared with [32m15.4¬†%[0m if a [31mprotective stoma[0m was not placed.
Most recently, in [35m2013[0m, [31mNurkin[0m et al. conducted a [31mretrospective review[0m of [34m211[0m [31mhospitals[0m and a total of [34m1791[0m [31mpatients[0m that underwent low [31manterior[0m [31mresection[0m. [34mOne thousand two hundred sixty-six[0m [31mpatients[0m underwent a [31mlow pelvic anastomosis[0m with [34m606[0m receiving a diverting [31mstoma[0m and [34m660[0m receiving no [31mstoma[0m. They found no differences in [31mwound complications[0m, [31msepsis[0m, or [31mincidence[0m of [31mseptic shock[0m between the [34mtwo[0m [31mgroups[0m. However, [31mpatients[0m in the [31mstoma group[0m were more likely to develop [31mpostoperative[0m [31macute kidney injury[0m. n [34m525[0m [31mpatients[0m who had a [31mcolo-anal anastomosis[0m without a [31mstoma[0m, there was a significant [31mrisk[0m of [31msepsis[0m, [31mseptic shock[0m, and [31mreoperation[0m. [31mMultivariate analysis[0m also showed that [31mpatients[0m who had a [31mcolo-anal anastomosis[0m without a [31mstoma[0m were at a considerable [31mrisk[0m for serious [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmorbidity[0m.
The [31mliterature[0m on the [31mtrue effects[0m of [31mdiversion[0m or [31mdefunctioning stomas[0m remains difficult to reconcile. [31mNonrandomized trials[0m are hampered by the fact that there exists a strong general [31mpatient[0m selection bias in these [31mstudies[0m favoring [31msurgery[0m without a [31mstoma[0m. This [31mbias[0m is inherent since these [31mstudies[0m [31mhinge[0m on the [31msurgeon‚Äôs[0m discretion at selectively creating a [31mstoma[0m or diverting those [31manastomoses[0m in which [31mcomplications[0m are [31manticipated[0m.
[33mGraffner[0m et al. [31mrandomized[0m [34m50[0m [31mpatients[0m into [34mtwo[0m [31mgroups[0m: [34m25[0m received a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m and [34m25[0m received [31mno stoma[0m. [34mThree[0m [31mclinically[0m relevant [31mAL[0m were seen in the [31mno stoma[0m group vs. [34monly one[0m [31mAL[0m in the [31mstoma group[0m. The overall [31mleakage[0m [31mrate[0m was [32m8¬†%[0m. [31mPakkastie[0m et al. [31mevaluated[0m [34m134[0m [31mpatients[0m and showed a [31mclinical[0m [31mleakage[0m [31mrate[0m of [32m16¬†%[0m in the [31mstoma group[0m, whereas [32m32¬†%[0m of [31mpatients[0m without a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m developed [31mclinically[0m evident [31mleakage[0m. Although all [31mpatients[0m with a [31mleak[0m in the no [31mstoma group[0m had to be [31mreoperated[0m, [34monly one[0m [31mreoperation[0m was necessary in the [31mpatients[0m with a [31mdefunctioning colostomy[0m.
A large recent [31mRCT[0m on the role of diverting [31mstoma[0m was performed by [33mMatthiessen et al[0m. [34mTwo hundred thirty-four[0m [31mpatients[0m were [31mrandomized[0m into [34mtwo[0m arms: [31mstoma[0m vs. [31mno stoma[0m. An [31manastomotic leak[0m developed in [32m10.3¬†%[0m of [31mpatients[0m with a [31mstoma[0m and in [34m28[0m¬†% of [31mundiverted[0m [31mpatients[0m. This difference was [31mstatistically significant[0m. As expected, the number of [31mreoperations[0m was significantly higher in the [31mgroup[0m of [31mpatients[0m without a [31mstoma[0m. The largest [31mRCT[0m was done by [36mChude et al.[0m and included [34m256[0m [31mpatients[0m with [34m120[0m [31mrandomized[0m to [31mno diversion[0m and 136 [31mrandomized[0m to diverting [31mileostomy[0m. The [31mstoma group[0m was found to be superior with [34m3[0m [31mclinical leaks[0m vs. [34m12[0m in the [31mno diversion[0m group. Furthermore, the [31mstoma group[0m required no return to the [31moperating room[0m [31mcompared[0m to [34mtwo[0m [31mpatients[0m in the [31mno diversion[0m group who required [31mreoperation[0m.
Huser et all performed a [31msystematic review[0m of all [31mretrospective studies[0m comparing the role of diverting [31mileostomy[0m. This included [31mstudies[0m that selectively used [31mstomas[0m, routinely used [31mstomas[0m and those that rejected using [31mstomas[0m. No clear [31mconsensus[0m from these [31mstudies[0m could be reached due to the aforementioned [31mselection bias[0m that meant most ‚Äú[31mhigh-risk‚Äù[0m [31mpatients[0m were included in the [31mdiversion group[0m. However, it should be noted that despite the strong [31mselection[0m bias favoring the no [31mstoma group[0m, [31mpatients[0m who received a diverting [31mileostomy[0m fared no worse.
[33mHuser[0m also performed a [31mmeta-analysis[0m of [31mrandomized prospective studies[0m on diverting [31mileostomy[0m, which revealed a significantly lower risk of [31manastomotic leak[0m and lower [31mrisk[0m of [31mreoperation[0m in the [31mstoma group[0m. However, the [31mmortality[0m between the [34mtwo[0m [31mgroups[0m was found to be comparable. These [31mresults[0m were validated by a more recent [31mCochrane meta-analysis[0m of more [31mRCTs[0m by Montedori et all of a total of [34msix[0m [31mRCTs[0m that comprised [34m332[0m [31mpatients[0m in the [31mstoma group[0m vs. [34m316[0m in the [31mno diversion[0m group. The [31mpooled analysis[0m showed that the use of a [31mdefunctioning stoma[0m resulted in less [31manastomotic leakage[0m [34m0.33[0m; [32m95¬†%[0m [31mconfidence interval[0m ‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.21‚Äì0.53) and less urgent [31mreoperation[0m with [31mno significant[0m difference in [31mmortality[0m.
Despite the [31mpotential[0m [31mbenefits[0m of [31mfecal diversion[0m for many [31mpatients[0m undergoing [31mcolorectal surgery[0m, the [31mconstruction[0m of an [31mabdominal stoma[0m while common remains fraught with many [31mcomplications[0m and should not be considered [31mtrivial[0m. The [31mstoma[0m is usually constructed as the last step of a [31mcomplex[0m [31moperation[0m and even though it might not be as technically challenging, [31mmeticulous surgical technique[0m should be adhered to as a means to minimize [31mcomplications[0m. [31mComplications[0m after [31mstomas range[0m from [31mminor[0m, requiring only [31mlocal care[0m, to the [31mdevastating[0m, requiring [31mreoperation[0m and [31mprolonged[0m [31minpatient care[0m.
It has been [31mestimated[0m that [31m40‚Äì50¬†%[0m of [31mabdominal stomas[0m that are deemed [31mtemporary[0m are never reversed signifying that the decision to create a [31mstoma[0m is no trivial one and can have a significant [31meffect[0m on [31mpatients‚Äô[0m [31mlivelihood[0m. [31mStudies[0m have shown a wide range of reported [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplication[0m [31mrates[0m, ranging from [34m10 to 60[0m¬†%. This is likely due to the fact that [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplications[0m remain poorly defined by the [31msurgical community[0m. Interestingly, the most commonly sited [31mcomplaint[0m of [31mstoma[0m [31mpatients[0m is [31mperistomal skin irritation[0m, which is a [31mcomplication[0m that is not always recognized by the [31mtreating surgeon[0m. Furthermore, in most [31msurgical practices[0m, this is a [31mcomplaint[0m that is seen and managed by [31mwound ostomy nurses[0m and may not always be reported to the [31mtreating surgeon[0m, thus the widely [31mfluctuating[0m [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplication[0m [31mrates[0m.
The [31mrisk factors[0m for [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplications[0m can be divided into [31mpatient-centered[0m, procedure-centered, and [31mdisease-centered factors[0m. [31mPatient factors[0m include [31mage[0m, [31mgender[0m, [31mBMI[0m, [31mnutritional status[0m, [31mamerican society[0m of [31manesthesiologists[0m [31mphysical status classification system[0m, and [31msteroid use[0m. [33mNastro[0m et al. showed a [31mcomplication[0m [31mrate[0m of [34m56[0m¬†% in a large recent series. [31mRheumatoid arthritis[0m, [31mimmobility[0m, high [31mASA[0m, and [31msurgery[0m for [31mcancer[0m were all found to be independent [31mrisk factors[0m. [31mSmoking[0m, [31mdiabetes[0m, and [31mmalignancy[0m had the [31mhighest[0m [31mrisk[0m for [31mpostoperative[0m [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplications[0m. With regards to [31mprocedure-centered factors[0m, [36mCottam et al.[0m also prospectively studied [34m3970[0m [31mcases[0m in [34m93[0m [31mhospitals[0m and found that [31mshort stomas[0m with a [31mheight less[0m than 1¬†cm was [31massociated with[0m higher [31mrate[0m of [31mearly complications[0m. [31mProcedures[0m performed on an [31memergent[0m basis were also at higher [31mrisk[0m for [31mcomplications[0m. It is alarming to note that despite the many advances in [31msurgical[0m and [31mpostoperative care[0m, the [31mrates[0m of [31mstomal[0m [31mcomplications[0m remain [31mhigh[0m. This fact puts more emphasis toward [31mweighing[0m the [31mpotential[0m [31mbenefits[0m vs. [31mrisks[0m of a diverting [31mstoma[0m and the [31moptimization[0m of [31mpatient factors[0m [31mpreoperatively[0m.
A poorly located [31mstoma[0m can be a major [31msource[0m of [31mmorbidity[0m and [31mfrustration[0m to [31mpatients[0m, with most of these [31missues[0m discovered after [31mpatients[0m are [31mdischarged home[0m. There has been ample [31mevidence[0m that an [31mimproperly[0m located [31mstoma[0m will lead to elements of [31mpsychological distress[0m, [31mpoor body image[0m, hamper [31mpostoperative[0m [31mrecovery[0m, and even lead to [31mpostoperative depression[0m in some [31msevere[0m [31mcases[0m. This is in an addition to the sizable [31meconomic burden[0m that a [31mmalfunctioning stoma[0m imposes due to [31mleakage[0m and the [31mrequirement[0m of more [31mstomal supplies[0m.
[31mStomal site[0m marking by a [31mwound ostomy[0m [31mnurse[0m should be advocated in all [31melective cases[0m and even in urgent ones if possible. This not only [31mimproves[0m [31msite selection[0m but also introduces the [31mpatient[0m and their [31mfamily[0m to [31mstoma education[0m and [31mresources[0m [31mearly[0m on thus empowering [31mpostoperative[0m [31mindependence[0m. As a [31mgeneral principle[0m, a proper site is one that is away from [31mbony prominences[0m and proposed [31mincisions[0m. A [31mflat area[0m of [31mhealthy skin[0m [34mat least 2[0m-in. wide in [31mdiameter[0m is [31mideal[0m, this usually corresponds to an [31marea[0m [34mtwo thirds[0m of the way from the [31manterior[0m superior [31miliac spine[0m toward the [31mumbilicus[0m. The [31mstoma[0m is then brought through the [31mrectus abdominis muscle[0m in a [31mmuscle splitting technique[0m. To anticipate [31mpotential[0m [31mpositional problems[0m, it is recommended to examine [31mpatients[0m while they are [31mstanding[0m, [31msitting[0m, and [31msupine[0m as [31mchanges[0m in [31mposition[0m will elucidate problematic areas of [31mskin creasing[0m and [31mexcessive[0m pads of [31mfat[0m. In [31mobese[0m [31mpatients[0m, it is recommended that [31mstomas[0m are placed higher than the usual [31mlocation[0m in areas of the [31mabdominal wall[0m that have thinner [31msubcutaneous fat[0m and thus allowing better [31mvisualization[0m and [31maccess[0m.
These are probably the most commonly encountered yet most underreported [31mcomplications[0m of [31mstoma use with[0m reported [31mincidences[0m [34mbetween 18 to 55[0m¬†%. [31mSkin complications[0m range from [31mmild irritation[0m to large areas of [31mulceration[0m and [31minfection[0m. This is most optimally [31mprevented[0m by proper [31mstoma[0m [31mplacement[0m and [31mconstruction[0m. [31mPatients[0m with [31mdifficulty covering[0m [31mstomas[0m are the [31mhighest[0m [31mrisk[0m for [31mskin complications[0m. This is particularly true for [31mobese[0m [31mpatients[0m who have [31missues[0m with properly fitting [31mstoma appliances[0m around [31mbody folds[0m. The [31mabsence[0m of [31mcare[0m by [31mwound ostomy nurses[0m has actually been [31midentified[0m as the greatest [31mrisk factor[0m for developing these [31mperistomal skin issues[0m. [31mPatients[0m should be [31massessed[0m for their [31mproficiency[0m at [31mstoma care[0m and [31mappliance placement[0m and [31mremoval[0m to minimize [31mmechanical causes[0m of [31mskin damage[0m. Furthermore, although proper [31mfit[0m is crucial in the initial setting, [31mpatients[0m need to be constantly refitted [31mpostoperatively[0m as [31mstomal swelling[0m [31mdecreases[0m and this should be continued for the [31mlifetime[0m of the [31mstoma[0m as the [31mpatient‚Äôs abdominal wall[0m [31mchanges[0m.
A notorious [31mcomplication[0m of [31mstomas[0m and a recurring [31mcause of hospital readmissions[0m are [31mdehydration[0m or [31melectrolyte abnormalities[0m from [31mexcessive[0m [31mstoma output[0m. The reported [31mincidence ranges[0m from [34m1[0m to [32m16¬†%[0m. It is not uncommon to have [31mvolumes[0m up to [34m2[0m¬†[36mL/day[0m as [31mpostoperative bowel edema[0m [31mimpairs[0m [31mfluid[0m [31mabsorption[0m across [31mmucosal membranes[0m. [31mHypokalemia[0m, [31mhypomagnesaemia[0m, and [31mhypocalcaemia[0m are all common [31mfindings[0m and [31mdehydration[0m leading to [31macute renal injury[0m is surprisingly common. [31mPatients[0m are at [31mhighest[0m [31mrisk[0m around the fourth to [31meighth day[0m [31mpostoperatively[0m which means that most of them have already been [31mdischarged home[0m by the [31mtime[0m these [31missues[0m arise. [31mPatients[0m should be educated to [31mmonitor[0m their [31mostomy[0m [31moutput[0m closely and should adjust their [31mPO[0m [31mfluid[0m [31mintake[0m accordingly once [31moutput[0m exceeds [34m1[0m¬†[36mL/day[0m. [31mPatients[0m are taught that [31mfrequent[0m [31memptying[0m of [31mstoma bags[0m, [31mleakage[0m, [31mnausea[0m, [31mdizziness[0m, [31mmalaise[0m, or [31mfatigue[0m are all signs of [31mexcessive[0m [31mfluid loss[0m. [31mPatients[0m should avoid [31mhypotonic fluids[0m that cause [31mhyponatremia[0m and use balanced [31mglucose-electrolyte[0m [31mbalanced solutions[0m for [31mfluid replacement[0m. Additional [31mpharmacologic treatments[0m such as [31mloperamide[0m and [31mdiphenoxylate[0m are used in [31mintractable[0m [31mcases[0m and after [31mconcurrent[0m [31minfectious diarrhea[0m have been ruled out.
[31mParastomal hernia[0m is a [31mfeared[0m and troublesome [31mlong-term[0m [31mcomplication[0m with its [31mincidence[0m [31mincreasing[0m with [31mincreasing[0m [31mtime[0m from the [31mindex[0m [31moperation[0m and reaching [34m15[0m to [32m40¬†%[0m of all [31mcases[0m. [31mLiterature[0m has confirmed that [31mstoma[0m [31mlocation[0m and [31mtype[0m do not [31mincrease[0m the [31mrisk[0m of [31mparastomal hernia[0m. [31mRisk factors[0m for [31mparastomal hernias[0m [31mmirror[0m known [31mrisk factors[0m for other types of [31mabdominal hernias[0m. [33mNastro[0m et al. showed that the [31mpresence[0m of [31mdiabetes[0m, [31mpoor respiratory status[0m, [31mcancer surgery[0m, and [31mend colostomy[0m as significant [31mrisk factors[0m for developing [31mparastomal hernia[0m. [31mOptions[0m for [31mcorrecting[0m [31mparastomal hernias[0m include [31mlocal repair[0m, [31mrelocation[0m, and [31mrepair[0m with [31mmesh[0m. Due to the poor results with the [30mfirst[0m [34mtwo[0m [31moptions[0m, there has been [31mincreased[0m recent [31menthusiasm[0m toward the use of [31mprophylactic mesh[0m, especially with the recent [31madvent[0m of [31mbiologic mesh[0m that can be used in [31mcontaminated fields[0m. [36mSerra-Aracil et al.[0m conducted a [31mtrial[0m of [31mprophylactic[0m [31mbiologic mesh[0m vs. a [31mcontrol group[0m with no [31mmesh[0m and saw a [31msignificant[0m [34m25[0m¬†% [31mreduction[0m in the [31mrate[0m of [31mparastomal hernia[0m between the [34mtwo[0m [31mgroups[0m.
[31mStoma[0m [31mcreation[0m has an [31mimpact[0m on [31meveryday[0m [31mlife[0m with common [31mphysical[0m, [31msocial[0m, and [31mmental impairments[0m. [33mRobertson[0m et al. showed that [31mstoma[0m [31mpatients[0m primarily face [31mskin irritation[0m, [31msmell[0m, [31mleakage[0m, and [31msocial stigma[0m ; all [31missues[0m that are not always brought to the attention of the [31msurgeon[0m. It has been shown that having a [31mstoma[0m [31mnegatively[0m affects [31mquality of life[0m and that [31mpositive[0m [31madjustment[0m is related to its [31macceptance[0m. Having [31meducational programs[0m with dedicated [31mwound ostomy[0m [31mnurse teams[0m have been advocated to [31mincrease[0m the [31mquality of life[0m of [31mstoma[0m [31mpatients[0m. A [31msystematic review[0m by [33mDanielsen et al.[0m showed that having a dedicated [31mstoma education program[0m and [31mteam[0m significantly [31mincreased[0m [31mpatients[0m‚Äô [31mquality of life[0m, [31mproficiency[0m in [31mmanagement[0m of [31mstoma[0m, [31mreduced[0m length of stay, [31mreduced[0m [31mhospital costs[0m, and [31mincreased[0m [31mpsychosocial adjustment[0m.
Despite the argument for [31mfecal diversion[0m to protect a [31mcolorectal anastomosis[0m, the [31moptimal[0m [31mmethod[0m of doing so is still [31munclear[0m. [34mFour[0m [31mrandomized controlled trials[0m compared [31mloop[0m [31mileostomy[0m and [31mloop colostomy head to head[0m, with [34mtwo[0m favoring [31mloop ileostomy[0m and [34mtwo[0m favoring [31mloop colostomy[0m. Both types of [31mstomas[0m carry a high [31mcomplication[0m [31mrate[0m and considerable [31mmorbidity[0m. A [31mCochrane review[0m of [34mfive[0m [31mrandomized trials[0m included a total of [34m334[0m [31mpatients[0m with [34m168[0m [31mpatients[0m receiving a [31mloop ileostomy[0m and [34m166[0m [31mpatients[0m receiving a [31mloop colostomy[0m. [31mStomal prolapse[0m was seen to be significantly less with [31mloop ileostomy[0m but with [31mconcurrent[0m [31mstatistical heterogeneity[0m. However, no other [31mclinical factors[0m including [31mmortality[0m, [31mwound infection[0m, [31mparastomal hernia[0m, [31mreoperation[0m, [31manastomotic leak[0m, [31mincisional hernia[0m, and [31mbowel obstruction[0m were found to be significantly different between [31mileostomy[0m and [31mcolostomy[0m.
Thus, current [31mevidence[0m dictates that [31mloop ileostomy[0m is the [31mprocedure[0m of choice for [31mfecal diversion[0m due to probable [31mlower risk[0m of [31mstomal prolapse[0m and equivalent [31mclinical outcomes[0m otherwise. Large-scale [31mrandomized clinical trials[0m are still needed, however, to validate these [31mresults[0m.
[31mFecal diversion[0m via a [31mloop ileostomy[0m or [31mcolostomy[0m remains a popular [31msurgical intervention[0m to protect a [31mhigh-risk[0m [31mcolorectal anastomosis[0m. [31mEvidence[0m shows that despite the fact that [31mfecal diversion[0m does not [31mdecrease[0m [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmortality[0m, it does significantly [31mdecrease[0m the [31mrisk[0m of [31manastomotic leak[0m and the need for urgent [31mreoperation[0m when a [31mleak[0m does occur. Diverting [31mstomas[0m are a [31mlow-risk[0m [31msurgical procedure[0m from a [31mtechnical standpoint[0m but carry significant [31mpostoperative[0m [31mmorbidity[0m that can greatly hamper [31mpatients[0m‚Äô [31mquality of life[0m and [31mrecovery[0m. The [31mdecision[0m for [31mfecal diversion[0m should be a [31mjoint[0m one between the [31mpatient[0m and [31msurgeon[0m, where [31mcomprehensive[0m informed consent of the [31mperceived[0m [31mbenefits[0m and [31mconcurrent[0m [31mmorbidity[0m and [31mcomplications[0m is [31messential[0m. [31mSurgeons[0m should strongly consider [31mdiversion[0m in [31mpatients[0m with [31mlow colorectal anastomoses[0m, [31mcolo-anal anastomoses[0m, technically difficult [31mresections[0m, [31mmalnutrition[0m, and [31mmale[0m [31mpatients[0m. [31mLoop ileostomy[0m is the [31mfecal diversion procedure[0m of [31mchoice[0m due to a significantly lower [31mrisk[0m of [31mprolapse[0m and [31mequivalent[0m [31moutcomes[0m with [31mcolostomy[0m otherwise.
